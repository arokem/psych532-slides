# Questions for today

- Do data-intensive methods change our ethical considerations?
- What new ethical considerations arise when conducting data-intensive research?
- What are some new safeguards we might consider?

# Foundations of ethics in biomedical research

::: {.small}

- Nuremberg trials and the Nuremberg code (1947)
  - Basic principles: continual informed consent, risk minimization
- Declaration of Helsinki (1964)
  - World Medical Association
  - Serves as the basis for the system of IRB
- Belmont Report (1979)
  - Respect for persons
  - Beneficience
  - Justice

# Big data or naturally occurring datasets (BONDS)

- Collected not for research purposes
- E.g., data from social media


# Examples

- Decision-making quantified based on search engine data (Moat et al.)
- Decision-making in used car purchases (Pope)
- Corpus analysis of language demonstrating correlation of phonetic and semantic distances (Christiansen and Monaghan)
- Theories of learning tested in educational technology (Koedinger et al.)

# Some worrisome signs

- Scraping of data from OK Cupid (2016-2018)
  - Release of the data as an open dataset
  - Use of the data to classify sexual orientation
- Human experimentation at scale
  - Facebook emotional contagion study (2014)
- The Menlo report (2012): US DHS


# Recasting the Belmont principles

- Respect
  - Informed consent in digital services is very problematic
- Beneficience
  - Minimizing the data that is collected
  - Indirect harms
- Justice
  - Representation
  - Algorithmic justice

# Identifiability

- Latanya Sweeney : ["Only You, Your Doctor, and Many Others May Know"](https://techscience.org/a/2015092903/)
- Some data is deidentified on its own
- But when combined with other available data becomes identifiable
- Was able to find the medical records of the MA governor
- Cross-referenced age, gender, zip code between:
  - Publicly available voter rolls
  - Newly released "anonymized" health records of state employees.
