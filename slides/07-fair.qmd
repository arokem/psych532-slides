# What constitutes "Good data management"?

- Let's assume that we all agree that data needs to be shared as part of the scientific process
- What does that _actually_ mean?

# FAIR

- Findable
- Accessible
- Interoperable
- Reusable

# Findable:

- F1. (meta)data are assigned a globally unique and persistent identifier
- F2. data are described with rich metadata (defined by R1 below)
- F3. metadata clearly and explicitly include the identifier of the data it describes
- F4. (meta)data are registered or indexed in a searchable resource

# Globally unique and persistent identifiers

::: {small}
- Needed to make sure that you know what is described.
- DOI: Digital Object Identifier
  - Strong guarantees of persistence and uniqueness
  - You can get a DOI for your data!
  - Zenodo
  - OSF
- Another kind of globally unique and persistent identifier: ORCID
- Searchability is still a very hard problem
:::

# Accessible

- A1. (meta)data are retrievable by their identifier using a standardized communications protocol
  - A1.1 the protocol is open, free, and universally implementable
  - A1.2 the protocol allows for an authentication and authorization procedure, where necessary
- A2. metadata are accessible, even when the data are no longer available

# Accessible â‰  open

- For example, some personal data cannot be openly shared.

# Interoperable

- I1. (meta)data use a formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language for knowledge representation.
- I2. (meta)data use vocabularies that follow FAIR principles
- I3. (meta)data include qualified references to other (meta)data

# Example: JSON-LD

A language for linking between different pieces of data

```json
{
  "@context": "https://json-ld.org/contexts/person.jsonld",
  "@id": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Lennon",
  "name": "John Lennon",
  "born": "1940-10-09",
  "spouse": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cynthia_Lennon"
}
```

# Reusable

- R1. meta(data) are richly described with a plurality of accurate and relevant attributes
  - R1.1. (meta)data are released with a clear and accessible data usage license
  - R1.2. (meta)data are associated with detailed provenance
  - R1.3. (meta)data meet domain-relevant community standards

# Reusable

# A few interesting follow-ups to FAIR

- The FAIR principles for software
- The CARE principles for Indigenous Data Governance


# FAIR for software

[Barker et al., 2022](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01710-x)

- Different versions of the software are assigned distinct identifiers
- Software licenses are distinct from data use licenses.

# The CARE principles for indigenous data governance

- Collective benefit
- Authority to control
- Responsibility
- Ethics
