# Why visualize?

- We've already seen that visualizations are an important data analysis tool (Loftus)
- Visualization for analysis vs. visualization for communication:
  - "Reveal relationships in large datasets..."
  - "...and communicate information to a broad audience"
  - Not necessarily the same thing!

# Reveal relationships

:::{.fragment}
... in large datasets?

# A few basic items

From Allen et al. (2012)

- Are the axes labeled?
- Are scales and units indicated?
- Is there a measure of uncertainty (e.g., error bars)?
- Is the type of uncertainty (e.g., SEM, CI, ...) indicated?


# Show more, hide less

- From bar plots ...
- ... to box plots ...
- ... to swarm plots, violin plots, ...

# Show more, hide less

# Using color

- Think about accessibility
  - About 5-8% of males + 0.5-1% of females cannot distinguish certain shades of red and green
- Color is itself multidimensional
  - Can use hue and saturation/transparency independently
- Using the right colormap matters
  - Color maps: each number maps to a color
  - Avoid colormaps that are not perceptually uniform

# Perceptually uniform colormaps

# Solutions?

- Use grayscale
- Use a colormap that is optimized for perceptual uniformity
- [Viridis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAoljeRJ3lU)

# Aligning graphics and concepts

Based on Goldstone et al. (2015)
::: {.small}
- Continuous dimensions with continuously perceived graphical attributes:
  - Saturation
  - Size
  - Position along an axis
- Categorical dimensions with categorically perceived graphical attributes:
  - Hue
  - Shape
- If using time (e.g., in animation) match that with time in the experiment.
  - If that's a relevant dimension.

# So, have we solved the curse of dimensionality?

# Using animations

Can help with visualization of complex three-dimensional structures

# Dimensionality reduction approaches

::: {fragment}
> "To deal with hyper-planes in a 14-dimensional space, visualize a 3D space and say 'fourteen' very loudly. Everyone does it." - Geoff Hinton
:::

- Linear dimensionality reduction: PCA
- Non-linear approaches:
  - t-SNE
  - UMAP
  - ...
